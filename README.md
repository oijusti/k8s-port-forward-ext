# Kubernetes Port Forward – Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies port forwarding for Kubernetes services with an interactive UI.

## Features

- List all available services across namespaces or in a specific namespace
- Select one or multiple services simultaneously for single or batch port forwarding
- Select services and environments (dev, qa, stg, prod, default) through an intuitive UI
- Automatic port detection for Kubernetes services
- Custom local and remote port configuration
- Real-time status updates with spinner animations
- Dedicated output channel for each port-forwarding session
- Option to view real-time logs for the selected service

## Requirements

- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) installed and configured
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- Kubernetes pods following the naming convention described below

## Service Naming Convention

This extension expects Kubernetes pods to follow a specific naming pattern:

```
<service-name>-<deployment-id>
```

Where:

- `<service-name>`: The actual service name
- `<deployment-id>`: The deployment identifier (typically auto-generated by Kubernetes)

Example:

```
dev-identity-services-auth-claim-store-66ff887974-hg8td
```

In this example:

- Service name: `dev-identity-services-auth-claim-store`
- Deployment ID: `66ff887974-hg8td`

The extension will extract the service name from this pattern and group services by name across environments.

## Usage

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Kubernetes: Port Forward" and select the command
3. Select a namespace from the list (or choose `--all-namespaces` to search across all)
4. Select one or multiple services from the list using the multi-select picker
5. For each selected service:
   - Choose an environment (dev, qa, stg, prod, default)
   - Enter a local port (default: 3000)
   - Confirm or modify the detected destination port
   - The extension will start port forwarding in a dedicated terminal
   - Choose whether to view real-time logs for the service (Yes/No)
   - If you select "Yes", logs will appear in a separate terminal window
6. The extension processes each service sequentially, allowing you to configure each one individually
7. Each service gets its own terminal session with a unique name format: `k8s — <env~><service-name>:<local-port>`
